# BEW 2.5: Makescraper

Written in go1.16.5 windows/amd64

## Description

A robot that generates and downloads a shuffled gopher from [gopherize.me](https://gopherize.me/)

## Usage

1) clone the repository
2) `$ cd main`
3) `$ go run .`
4) That's it!

## Benchmark

To benchmark how long it takes to generate a gopher and retrieve its downloadUrl:

1) `$ cd main`
2) `$ go test -bench=.`

These steps should save a `my-gopher.png` file into the `main` directory
